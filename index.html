                    <p>
                      Hello! I'm Anushree Vupparapalli, hailing from the picturesque city of Hyderabad, Telangana, India. I'm a recent graduate of Chaitanya Bharathi Institute of Technology, where I had the privilege of pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology. My academic journey has been an enriching experience, fostering my passion for technology and equipping me with a solid foundation in various aspects of IT.

During my time at CBIT, I discovered my keen interest in the fields of nan, nan, nan, nan, and nan. These subjects captivated my imagination and ignited a desire to delve deeper into their applications. I immersed myself in coursework and extracurricular activities related to these domains, eager to expand my knowledge and hone my skills.

Beyond the classroom, I actively participated in hackathons and coding competitions, where I had the opportunity to put my abilities to the test and collaborate with like-minded individuals. These experiences not only enhanced my technical capabilities but also broadened my perspectives and fostered a sense of community within the tech ecosystem.

In my personal life, I find solace in listening to music and expressing myself through dance. These creative outlets allow me to unwind and recharge, balancing my academic pursuits with activities that bring me joy and fulfillment.

As I embark on the next chapter of my career, I am eager to leverage my skills and passion to make meaningful contributions to the field of IT. I am confident that my academic background, coupled with my drive and dedication, will enable me to succeed in any role that aligns with my interests. I am excited to connect with professionals in the industry and explore the opportunities that lie ahead.
